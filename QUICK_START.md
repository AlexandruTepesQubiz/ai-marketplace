# Quick Start Guide

## Already Have Supabase Set Up?

If you've already set up Supabase but users need to confirm their email before signing in, follow these steps to disable email confirmation:

### Disable Email Confirmation

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers** (in the left sidebar)
4. Click on **Email** provider
5. Find the **Confirm email** toggle switch
6. **Turn OFF** the "Confirm email" option
7. Click **Save**

That's it! Users can now sign in immediately after signing up without needing to confirm their email.

### Test It

1. Try signing up with a new account
2. You should be automatically logged in
3. Your name should appear in the header
